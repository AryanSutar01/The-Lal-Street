## 7. Performance Metrics Explained

### 7.1 Rolling Returns

**What it is**: Rolling returns calculate the return for a specific period (e.g., 3 years) starting from different dates. Instead of one 3-year period, you get multiple 3-year periods.

**Why it matters**: Shows consistency and volatility of returns over time.

**Example**: If a fund has a mean rolling return of 12%, it means on average, any 3-year period returned 12% annually.

### 7.2 CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)

**What it is**: The annualized return rate assuming your investment compounds over time.

**Why it matters**: Provides a standardized way to compare different investments over different time periods.

**Example**: If ₹1,00,000 becomes ₹1,40,000 in 3 years, the CAGR is approximately 11.9%.

### 7.3 XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)

**What it is**: Calculates returns considering the exact timing of cash flows (important for SIP investments).

**Why it matters**: More accurate than CAGR for investments with multiple cash flows at different times.

**Example**: For SIP investments, XIRR accounts for each monthly investment's timing.

### 7.4 Positive Periods Percentage

**What it is**: The percentage of time periods where the investment generated positive returns.

**Why it matters**: Indicates consistency. Higher percentage means more reliable returns.

**Example**: 85% positive periods means the investment was profitable 85% of the time.

### 7.5 Standard Deviation

**What it is**: A measure of volatility - how much returns vary from the average.

**Why it matters**: Lower standard deviation means more stable, predictable returns.

**Example**: A fund with 12% mean return and 3% standard deviation is more stable than one with 5% standard deviation.

### 7.6 Maximum and Minimum Returns

**What it is**: The best and worst returns achieved during the analysis period.

**Why it matters**: Shows the range of possible outcomes and helps assess risk tolerance.

**Example**: If maximum is 25% and minimum is -5%, you know the potential upside and downside.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Are Suggested Buckets guaranteed to perform as projected?

**A**: No. The projections are based on historical performance data and are not guarantees of future returns. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Use these as guidance, not promises.

### Q2: Can I modify a bucket after importing it?

**A**: Yes! After importing, you can add or remove funds, change weightages, or adjust any parameters in the calculators.

### Q3: How often is the performance data updated?

**A**: Performance data is automatically recalculated every 5 days (if the server is not under heavy load). The system uses the latest NAV (Net Asset Value) data available.

### Q4: What if a bucket doesn't have enough historical data?

**A**: The system requires at least 3 years of historical data for accurate calculations. If a fund doesn't have sufficient history, it may not be included in certain calculations.

### Q5: Can I create my own buckets?

**A**: Currently, only administrators can create buckets. However, you can create custom portfolios in the Investment or Retirement Plan pages by selecting your own funds.

### Q6: What's the difference between "Investment" and "Retirement" buckets?

**A**: 
- **Investment buckets**: Focused on wealth creation and growth
- **Retirement buckets**: Optimized for long-term retirement planning
- **Both**: Suitable for either purpose

### Q7: How are the projected returns calculated?

**A**: Projections use the 3-year mean rolling return and apply compound interest over 3 years. The calculation assumes ₹1,00,000 initial investment.

### Q8: Can I see performance for different time periods?

**A**: The detailed performance report shows 3-year and 5-year metrics. The bucket card shows 3-year projections, with UI ready for 5-year view (coming soon).

### Q9: What happens if I import the same bucket twice?

**A**: Importing again will replace your current fund selection with the bucket's funds. Your previous selections will be overwritten.

### Q10: Are there any fees associated with using suggested buckets?

**A**: No. The Suggested Buckets feature is free to use. However, actual mutual fund investments may have expense ratios and other fees as per the fund house terms.
