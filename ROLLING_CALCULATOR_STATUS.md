# üöß Rolling Calculator Update - In Progress

## ‚úÖ Completed:
1. Added imports for real NAV service and utilities
2. Removed mock data generation
3. Added loading/error state management  
4. Added minAvailableDate tracking
5. Started async calculateRolling function
6. Fetching real NAV data from backend

## ‚è≥ In Progress:
Updating the SIP simulation logic inside rolling windows to:
- Use real NAV data from navResponses array
- Apply getNextAvailableNAV() for proper date handling
- Implement same-day-each-month logic like SIP calculator
- Handle holidays and weekends properly

## üìù Next Steps:
1. Replace the daily loop with proper SIP date generation
2. Update both individual fund and bucket calculations
3. Add error UI components
4. Update date input constraints
5. Test with real funds

## Current File State:
- File is partially updated
- Basic structure in place
- Core calculation logic needs completion
- About 60% complete

The update is substantial but straightforward - replacing mock data patterns with real NAV lookups.
